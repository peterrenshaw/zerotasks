ABOUT

    This is a TODO system that I want to display the 
latest things I'm doing on both console and webpage 
AND/OR service online. In the example above, the TODO
list is integrated into bash and the console. 

Why?

The tool should 
be able to do the following:

  * add a TASK to a TODO LIST
  * modify the ORDER of a TASK 
  - this is called PRIORITY 
  * select TASK and start TIMER
  * work until TASK is finished OR work to a pre-set TIMER
  * show TODO LIST of finished TASK(s)
  * show TODO LIST of non-completd

  * show for each TASK
  - TIME started
  - TASK elapsed time
  - TIME completed
  - STATUS
  - COMMENT
  - PRIORITY


Problem solved

* Be able to enter a list of tasks, prioritize them.
* Select a TODO list (task list) to work on 
ct an individual TASK  to work on, time it and remove to TODO list
* Display completed tasks with time taken, order completed and status
  of completed tasks within TODO list, per time period.

Problems not to be solved

* Multiple assignment of tasks to others
* Calander application
* Latest front-end technology tools to be used
* Complicated data storage retrival
